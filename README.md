<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
This project is a real-estate clustering model built using scikit-learn library. It allows users to explore and analyze real-estate data to identify patterns and trends in different neighborhoods in Seoul. The user can find the apartments in a neighborhood that matches their preference the best using the model.

<h2 id="project">Project Description </h2>
### Features:
1. Data exploration and visualization using numpy, pandas, and folium
2. Data Collection using FourSquare API
2. Clustering of real-estate data using K-means algorithm from scikit-learn
3. The ability to change the number of clusters based on user input

### Tech Stack
1. Python 3.x
2. scikit-learn library for machine learning
3. folium library for data visualization
4. pandas and numpy for data manipulation
5. FourSquare API for data collection

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository 
2. Run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' to install all necessary dependencies
3. Run 'classification_model.ipynb'

<h2 id="todo">TODOs </h2>
1. Build a Web Application so that the user could use the interface to explore and analyze the potential apartment candidates by changing the number of clusters and interact with the map.
1. Deploy the App on the Cloud

Please note that it is important to have an internet connection to use the application as it pulls the data from APIs. Also the user should have an FourSquare API key to run the application.
